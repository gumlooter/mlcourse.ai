    "## <center> Part 1. User Identification with Logistic Regression <br>(beating baselines in the \"Alice\" competition)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Today we are going to practice working with sparse matrices, training Logistic Regression models, and doing feature engineering. We will reproduce a couple of baselines in the  Kaggle Inclass competition [\"Catch Me If You Can: Intruder Detection through Webpage Session Tracking\"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2) (a.k.a. \"Alice\"). More credits will be given for beating stronger baselines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to working on the assignment, you'd better check out the corresponding course material:\n",
    " 1. [Classification, Decision Trees and k Nearest Neighbors](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Yorko/mlcourse_open/blob/master/jupyter_english/topic03_decision_trees_kNN/topic3_decision_trees_kNN.ipynb?flush_cache=true), the same as an interactive web-based [Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-3-decision-trees-and-knn) (basics of machine learning are covered here)\n",
    " 2. Linear classification and regression in 5 parts: \n",
    "    - [ordinary least squares](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-4-linear-models-part-1-ols)\n",
    "    - [linear classification](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-4-linear-models-part-2-classification)\n",
    "    - [regularization](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-4-linear-models-part-3-regularization)\n",
    "    - [logistic regression: pros and cons](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-4-linear-models-part-4-more-of-logit)\n",
    "    - [validation](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-4-linear-models-part-5-validation)\n",
    " 3. You can also practice with demo assignments, which are simpler and already shared with solutions: \n",
    "    - \"Sarcasm detection with logistic regression\": [assignment](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a4-demo-sarcasm-detection-with-logit) + [solution](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a4-demo-sarcasm-detection-with-logit-solution)\n",
    "    - \"Linear regression as optimization\": [assignment](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a4-demo-linear-regression-as-optimization) (solution cannot be officially shared)\n",
    "    - \"Exploring OLS, Lasso and Random Forest in a regression task\": [assignment](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a6-demo-linear-models-and-rf-for-regression) + [solution](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a6-demo-regression-solution)\n",
    " 4. Alice baseline with logistic regression and \"bag of sites\", [Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/alice-logistic-regression-baseline)\n",
    " 5. Correct time-aware cross-validation scheme, more features, and hyperparameter optimization, [Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/correct-time-aware-cross-validation-scheme)\n",
    " 6. **\"Model validation in a competition\"**, [Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/model-validation-in-a-competition) - this one reproduces a solution with **0.95055** Public LB ROC AUC and gives a lot of hints how to proceed with this competition\n",
    " 7. Other [Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2/kernels?sortBy=voteCount&group=everyone&pageSize=20&competitionId=7173) in this competition. You can share yours as well, but not high-performing ones (Public LB ROC AUC shall be < 0.95055). Please don't spoil the competitive spirit. \n",
    " 8. If that's still not enough, watch two videos on logistic regression: [mlcourse.ai/lectures](https://mlcourse.ai/lectures)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:**\n",
    " 1. \"Follow me\". Complete the missing code and submit your answers via [the google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1a2PrdKsc7gV2fO7bSwO-uGVEWAY6CIxx-9YV5RNnDIs). Use **the same email and name** as in A1 and A2 (for newcomers: remember your email and use it for all forms during the course). 10 credits max. for this part\n",
    " 2. \"Freeride\". Come up with good features to beat the baselines \"A3 baseline (10 credits)\" (**0.95343** Public LB ROC-AUC, press \"Load more\" in the bottom of the [Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2/leaderboard) to actually see it) and \"A3 strong baseline (20 credits)\" (**0.95965** Public LB ROC-AUC). As names suggest, you'll get 10 more credits for beating the first one, and 10 more (20 in total) for beating the second one. You need to name your [team](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2/team) (out of 1 person) in full accordance with the [course rating](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15e1K0tg5ponA5R6YQkZfihrShTDLAKf5qeKaoVCiuhQ/) (for newcomers: you need to name your team with your real full name). You can think of it as a part of the assignment.\n",
    " 3. If you've beaten \"A3 baseline (10 credits)\" or performed better, you need to upload your solution as described in [course roadmap](https://mlcourse.ai/roadmap) (\"Kaggle Inclass Competition Alice\" -> Rules). For all baselines that you see on Public Leaderboard, it's OK to beat them on Public LB as well. But 10 winners will be defined according to the private LB, which will be revealed by @yorko on October 27. \n",

The interesting fact is that most of the elements of our matrix are zeros. If we count non-zero elements, then it will be about 1.8 million, i.е. slightly more than 10% of all matrix elements. Such a matrix, where most elements are zeros, is called sparse, and the ratio between the number of zero elements and the total number of elements is called the sparsity of the matrix.\n",

    "The quality of the model has decreased significantly. We added a feature that definitely seemed useful to us, but its usage only worsened the model. Why did it happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important detour #2: is it necessary to scale features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we give an intuitive reasoning (a rigorous mathematical justification for one or another aspect in linear models you can easily find on the internet). Consider the features more closely: those of them that correspond to the number of visits to a particular web-site per session vary from 0 to 10. The feature `start_month` has a completely different range: from 201301 to 201412, this means the contribution of this variable is significantly greater than the others. It would seem that problem can be avoided if we put less weight in a linear combination of attributes in this case, but in our case logistic regression with regularization is used (by default, this parameter is `C = 1`), which penalizes the model the stronger the greater its weights are. Therefore, for linear methods with regularization, it is recommended to convert features to the same scale (you can read more about the regularization, for example, [here](https://habrahabr.ru/company/ods/blog/322076/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is standardization: for each observation you need to subtract the average value of the feature and divide this difference by the standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^{*}_{i} = \\dfrac{x_{i} - \\mu_x}{\\sigma_x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following practical tips can be given:\n",
    "- It is recommended to scale features if they have essentially different ranges or different units of measurement (for example, the country's population is indicated in units, and the country's GNP in trillions)\n",
    "- Scale features if you do not have a reason/expert opinion to give a greater weight to any of them\n",
    "- Scaling can be excessive if the ranges of some of your features differ from each other, but they are in the same system of units (for example, the proportion of middle-aged people and people over 80 among the entire population)\n",
    "- If you want to get an interpreted model, then build a model without regularization and scaling (most likely, its quality will be worse)\n",
    "- Binary features (which take only values of 0 or 1) are usually left without conversion, (but)\n",
    "- If the quality of the model is crucial, try different options and select one where the quality is better\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting back to `start_month`, let us rescale the new feature and train the model again. This time the quality has increased:"
